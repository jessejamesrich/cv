I've crafted a simple showcase of my abilities in the form of this demo site, and I've made the repository available for download at [GitHub](https://github.com/jessejamesrich/cv).

This project elegantly demonstrates my skills across various domains of web development. From the front-end build using React, to the back-end powered by Node.js. It includes a REST API, a database, localization, and will grow as I continue to add to it.

This site is meant to be simple and showcase just the basics. The single largest project I have worked on is at [https://made.live](https://made.live), the scope of which should really highlight my abilities as a programmer. I encourage you to check out the features video for more information about my abilities.

Unfortunately, I do not speak either French or Spanish. The implementation of these languages is merely to show that localization is something I've worked on.

Below, I've attached some explanatory images to highlight some of the functionality.
